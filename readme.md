# DIGINEXT CLI & BUILD SERVER

**A BUILD SERVER** that run on your infrastructure and its **Command Line Interface (CLI)** with developer-friendly commands - a **must-have tool** of DevOps engineers. 

***Developers should not be frustrated by deploying their apps to the infrastructure, or bothering the DevOps engineers to help deploying it, they should fully focus on developing apps, they don't need to understand the servers, the domains, or infrastructure related stuffs. That's when `dx` come, `dx` is your DevOps assistant.***

| *Build faster. Deploy easier. More flexible.*

| `dx` also means **Developer Experience**, and this is our number one goal - create the best experience for developers.

## Getting Started

### If you are a developer and you just want to deploy your app immediately)

#### Required

-   Install `Docker` on your computer: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ 

#### Installation

Install the package globally:

```bash
npm i @topgroup/diginext --location=global
```

Login to our build server:

```bash
dx login https://app.diginext.site
cd /path/to/your/app
dx init
dx deploy
```

That's it!

---

Or login to your team's build server:

```bash
dx login https://buildserverdomain.example
cd /path/to/your/app
dx init
dx deploy
```

---

Start a new app from scratch:

```bash
dx new
```

## Build server

-   **Diginext** requires a MongoDB database to run the build server.

### If you want to run a build server for your own / team / organization

#### Run your server with Docker Compose (Recommended)

For fastest installation, we recommend to use our `docker-compose.yaml`, you will need to fill in some environment variables:

```bash
...
  # Add your credentials so you can use Google Sign-in to authenticate with your workspace later on:
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Then spin up the build server with: `docker compose up`, it will be available at: `http://localhost:6969`

Access the admin (`http://localhost:6969`) to configure your new workspace, add some cluster access information.

On the client side, use the CLI command `dx login http://your-workspace-domain.com` to login to your workspace and start new app with `dx new` or start deploying with `dx deploy`.

Read the [docs here](docs/docs.md).

#### Manual installation

-   Install `kubectl`: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
-   Install `MongoDB`: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/
-   Install `gcloud`: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#installation_instructions
-   Install `doctl`: https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/

Install the package globally:

```bash
npm i @topgroup/diginext --location=global
```

After installing, you can use the CLI command `dx` and spin up a build server with:

```bash
export MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=<YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING>
dx server up
```

The build server will be available at: http://localhost:6969

Access the admin to configure your new workspace, add some cluster access information.

On the client side, use the CLI command `dx login http://your-workspace-domain.com` to login to your workspace and start new app with `dx new` or start deploying with `dx deploy`.

For example, to deploy your project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
# initialize your application (register it with the build server)
dx init
# complete the form, then use the command below to deploy:
dx deploy
```
