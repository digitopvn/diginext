# DIGINEXT

### **A developer-focused platform for app deployment & centralized cloud resource management.**

https://diginext.site

***Developers should not be frustrated by deploying apps to the infrastructure, or bothering the DevOps engineers to help deploying it, they should fully focus on developing apps, they don't need to understand the servers, the domains, or infrastructure related stuffs.***

> *Focus on building your apps, shipping fast, and shinning, and leave your cloud infrastructure to Diginext.*

> `dx` also means **Developer Experience**, and this is my number one goal - create the best experience for developers - let's make coding great again.

## Roadmap

- Check out [this link](https://topgroup.notion.site/Roadmap-6a8266c2929c48ad8d4c11c954e9d852?pvs=4).

---

## Getting Started

- [Diginext website](https://diginext.site/?ref=github)
- [Official Workspace](https://app.diginext.site/?ref=github)
- [Documentation](https://docs.diginext.site/?ref=github)

#### CLI Installation

Install the package globally:

```bash
npm i @topgroup/diginext --location=global
```

#### CLI Update

- To update your CLI to the latest version: `dx update` or `npm update @topgroup/diginext --location=global`.

---

Login to your Diginext workspace:

```bash
dx login 
# is similar with:
# $ dx login https://app.diginext.site
# in case you hosted Diginext yourself:
# $ dx login https://<your-diginext-workspace-domain>
cd /path/to/your/app
dx init
dx up
```

That's it!

---

Start developing a new app from boilerplate frameworks:

```bash
dx new
```

Available frameworks:
‚úì Next.js
‚úì Nest.js
‚úì Static website with NGINX
‚úì More to come!

## Running Diginext platform on your own infrastructure

**Requirements:**
- A server: any computers with Ubuntu, Debian or CentOS

### 1. With installation script

Access into your server (directly or via SSH), then run this script:

```bash
curl -sfL https://diginext.site/install/microk8s | sh -
```

üëâ [Detailed instruction](https://dev.to/mrgoonie/i-turn-my-companys-pc-into-my-own-vercel-like-platform-351o)

### 2. With Docker Engine

-   **Diginext** requires a MongoDB database to run the build server.

For fastest installation, I recommend to use our `docker-compose.yaml`, you will need to fill in some environment variables:

```yaml
...
  # Add your credentials so you can use Google Sign-in to authenticate with your workspace later on:
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Then spin up the build server with: `docker compose up`, it will be available at: `http://localhost:6969`

Access the admin (`http://localhost:6969`) to configure your new workspace.

On the client side, use the CLI command `dx login http://your-workspace-domain.com` to login to your workspace and start new app with `dx new` or start deploying with `dx up` (or `dx deploy`).

üëâ Read the [docs here](https://docs.diginext.site/?ref=github).
